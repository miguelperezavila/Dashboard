# Dashboard

The aim of this project is visualized in a dashboard the data stored from a IoT system. This IoT system is in charge of control the street
lighting and is the main topic of my thesis project. I developed the complete system, from the node to the dashboard. In this GUI we 
connect with the database and collect al the data an show it to the user, who has to log in.

This project is based on the youtube channel of Angelsix.
